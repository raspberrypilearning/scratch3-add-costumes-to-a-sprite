You will need to position and resize the added costumes in the Paint editor, to match your other costumes.

**Tip:** If you position a sprite on the Stage and then change its costume, the sprite might appear to 'jump' or change size. You will need to position and resize the costumes in the Paint editor so that they all appear in the right position on the Stage.
